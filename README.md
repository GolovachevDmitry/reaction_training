This is a simple reaction training tool I built for personal use. However, it has some notable bugs:

If you press pause during the countdown before the round starts, the 'countdown' audio keeps playing and doesnâ€™t stop.
Functions take too long to terminate, causing issues when quickly stopping and starting a new round. This can lead to overlapping rounds where sounds and visual signals from the previous round continue to appear.
Other minor bugs and issues.
Feel free to suggest fixes or improvements!
